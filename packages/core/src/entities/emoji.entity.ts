 * Interface for a Discord emoji.
 * Represents both standard emoji (Unicode characters) and custom emoji for guilds or applications.
 *
 * There are three main types of emoji:
 * - Standard emoji: Unicode emoji with null ID
 * - Guild emoji: Custom emoji belonging to a specific guild
 * - Application-owned emoji: Custom emoji that can only be used by a specific application
 *
 * @remarks
 * Emojis have a maximum file size of 256 KiB.
 * Each guild can have up to 50 regular custom emoji and 50 animated custom emoji.
 * Premium emoji (with subscription roles) count towards a separate limit of 25.
 * An application can own up to 2000 emojis that can only be used by that app.
 *
 * @see {@link https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/emoji#emoji-object}
